# Cross-Origin Resource Sharing

Play provides a filter that implements Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

CORS is a protocol that allows web applications to make requests from the browser across different domains.  A full specification can be found [here|http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/].

## Enabling the CORS filter

To enable the CORS filter, add the Play filters project to your `libraryDependencies` in `build.sbt`:

@[content](code/filters.sbt)

Now add the CORS filter to your filters, which is typically done by creating a `Filters` class in the root of your project:

Scala
: @[filters](code/CorsFilter.scala)

Java
: @[filters](code/detailedtopics/configuration/cors/Filters.java)

## Configuring the CORS filter

The filter can be configured from `application.conf`.  For a full listing of configuration options, see the Play filters [`reference.conf`](resources/confs/filters-helpers/reference.conf).

The available options include:

* `play.filters.cors.pathPrefixes` - filter paths by a whitelist of path prefixes
* `play.filters.cors.allowOrigins` - allow only requests with origins from a whitelist (by default all origins are allowed)
* `play.filters.cors.allowHttpMethods` - allow only HTTP methods from a whitelist for preflight requests (by default all methods are allowed)
* `play.filters.cors.allowHttpHeaders` - allow only HTTP headers from a whitelist for preflight requests (by default all headers are allowed)
* `play.filters.cors.exposeHeaders` - set custom HTTP headers to be exposed in the response (by default no headers are exposed)
* `play.filters.cors.supportsCredentials` - disable/enable support for credentials (by default credentials support is enabled)
* `play.filters.cors.preflightMaxAge` - set how long the results of a preflight request can be cached in a preflight result cache (by default 1 hour)

For example:

```
play.filters.cors {
  pathPrefixes = ["/some/path", ...]
  allowOrigins = ["http://www.example.com", ...]
  allowHttpMethods = ["GET", "POST"]
  allowHttpHeaders = ["Accept"]
  preflightMaxAge = 3 days
}
```
